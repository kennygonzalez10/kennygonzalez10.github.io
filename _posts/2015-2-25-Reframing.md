One must keep in mind that at Design Solution in Miami one would pay $175 to $200 for basic option logo design. A more complex or prime option would be
about $300 to $400. What I offer as a freelancer with a small group of dedicated designers like me is the option to a basic option for no more than $100 and this covers up to 5 free revisions if you are not 100% about the logo plus a free updates. The prime option for more intricate logos would be no more than $250 and this covers up to 30 revisions, free updates, 20 free prints, and a free 32gb flashdrive.
