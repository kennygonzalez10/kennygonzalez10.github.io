What might you think the key to happiness really is? Is it money, romance, or family bond? To dig deeper into this question one must look at one’s self internally. What are your goals in life and what do you know about who you want to be as a person. In a blog from www.actionforhappiness.org shows you a list of actions you can take to at least start to have some happiness in your life. To view these actions click [here](http://www.actionforhappiness.org/take-action) to get inspired to help others and specially yourself. As for myself I take the list of actions in this blog seriously and at least practice most of them without even noticing. I believe that to have a happier life and thus be happy one must love one self, not to the point where you are selfish and self absorb, but love yourself for every part that is you. One person might say that your ears are to big and then you might get all sad and get all insecure about it. Once you have that internal love for yourself and your image then that’s when you become infectious to everyone around you. People can sense that you value yourself and that you are able to appreciate them for who they are because you have done the same for yourself.
