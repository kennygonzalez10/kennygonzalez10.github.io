Welcome people to the world of **HTML** short for Hyper Text Markup Language, what is this weird word we are talking about and what does it mean. Well lets start off by saying that HTML is the structure of a web page and it is written in certain codes to manipulate the placement and layout of a webpage element. Of course when you first start doing your own coding it can be hard to interpret the outcome of a code but once you know what a piece of code does then everything become extremely easy. Think of HTML are the building blocks of web pages. This is how HTML works, heading are described by heading elements. There are six levels of heading elements: h1 to h6

The h1 element is used to describe the main heading of the page.

**Opening tag** **Closing Tag**
 **|**               **|**
**< h1 > Web Development. < /h1 >**

This code appears on the landing page of your website. What this code does it display whatever is written between the h1 tag is going to display on the web page. There are other codes that display different component on a web page. These components consist of text, images, links, and others. The most important element is the body elements. The body element contains the actual content of the web page - everything nested inside **<body>** **</body>** shows up in the web browser. This is just a preview of what you can do with HTML the best resource to start learning HTML is [www.codeacademy.com](www.codeacademy.com).
