My utmost favorite Adobe Suite Programs has to be InDesign and Photoshop programs. The InDesign makes using text and images much easier and the program has better handling in making these elements symmetrically balanced and easy to move around. Photoshop is just a beast of a program by itself. It can do literally anything you want to an image file of your choosing. One of the things I enjoy about Photoshop is the amount of manipulation you can do to an image to make it look like you've transform an image that you've taken from an authorized source or taken it yourself with a nice camera.
