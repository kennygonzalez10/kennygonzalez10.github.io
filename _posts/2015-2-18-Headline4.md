In a world where technology is rapidly evolving especially in the field of web design we seem to have gone from knowing everything that we have to know to succeed to keep learning everything that is new and upcoming. One must know this philosophy, "That to have learn something does not mean you've learn its growth and potential". Meaning you can learn something today and tomorrow that one thing that you've learn has been change fro the thing you understood to the thing you must now look deeper into. With that said I want to give you some killer advice about web developing that can help you become a better web designer. These tips can be used in other personal careers but I am just focusing on the web design concept of it. Before a web developer comes up with a good website he has to analyze the main objective of that website, is it to sell a product, to create a social following, or to just post useful information. After you get the objective down then you start analyzing who your target audience, are there in a certain age group, what kind of music they listen to, where they live and so on. Once that is done you dissect what that certain target audience like and use those things in your design, this process takes the most time and the most thinking, chances are you are not going to be doing this part of the process by yourself. This process requires collaborative working and extensive discussion. After discussing about what colors to use, what fonts to use, and the layout now you must start sketching out ideas for a webpage according to the information you have gather from analyzing your target audience. Best thing you can do in this last step is to come up with at least four concrete web designs to entertain into developing. I hope this information has helped you open your eyes about the process of coming up with good ideas for web page design.
