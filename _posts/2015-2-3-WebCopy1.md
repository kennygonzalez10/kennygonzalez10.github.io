*Web copy* is advertised writing that is put on the web. The people in charge of writing these texts are called copywriters. The text on the web page must stop readers in their tracks, meaning it must not look like an advertisement, in other words it must inform the reader and inspire some sort of curiosity to the reader. Making sure that you are writing clear, to the point, and create something that communicates the gist of what your website is trying to achieve, whether if it's trying to sell, create followers, or just simply give out information is very important for the process of web copy. By following are these procedures you are putting yourself ahead of other copywriters because you are building a relationship with the customer, visitor, or client. Potential customers do not like to be bombarded with ads that are always asking them to buy something. This approach always comes out as too aggressive and it will a 100% of the time fail, especially if you are selling or offering something that is not well known or new. It is best that you give them useful information to the customer or the visitor of your website that will help them make an educated decision. Also introduce your product or service in words in a interesting manner that forces the visitor to want information.
