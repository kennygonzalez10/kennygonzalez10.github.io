*SEO* (Search Engine Optimization) is a system used by search engines to rank websites based on a number of specifications. Being able to optimize these specifications to the liking of the search engine can put your desired website on the top of the list. If your optimization is off the search engine will rank you down on the their list and you will have to approach the problem in a analytical matter keeping the specifications in mind. Keywords, content, links, social media,(etc.) influences the success of your website in a search engine. Making sure the keywords you use are not simple or generic can help alot, for example, if you search the word "bat" on google you are going to get millions of results dealing with the word "bat", which means you are competing with millions of websites dealing with that topic. So to make your chances better so that the user visits your site and acquire their desired product or service you must specify your keywords. If your keyword is "bats for sale miami" your chances become much better because you are targeting a localized area and a group of people who might be looking for your product in that area. Search engine optimization is a very critical long process that needs to be thought out with the customer needs and business objective in mind.
