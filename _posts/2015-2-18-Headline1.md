There are many products out there that are really good for organizing files that keeping records of them. But not many products offer the productivity and the efficiency of the *Neat Desk Scanners*. This machine is able to scan all kinds of file sizes and file formats and organizes them for you in the most organized and speedy manner. Many professional institutions and business use them to upload personal documents of their clients or their company's records. Before the Neat was announced to the world it was first commercialized on TV as part of a technological novelty product. Now it is sold commercially everywhere by many retail sellers. I remember when I first seen the commercial I did not think much of the Neat scanner and at that time I was like 12 years old. The Neat back then was not that popular because it was a new product in the market. Now I am working at an office retail store and selling this product to people. I recommend this product to many customers that walk in looking for a scanner that is going to do the job right. Many people look for a reasonable price but then again who doesn't when there are a million options out there when you are looking for a certain product. The Neat comes in three forms. The first one is the portable scanner that is small and can fit in a regular size backpack or even a purse. The price range for that scanner varies between retailers from $99.99-$150. The second scanner in the Neat power house is the Neat Connect Wireless, this scanner is the next step up for wireless speed scanning, you have the option to subscribe to Neat's special cloud which allows you to set up filters for how you want your files to be organized and from those settings the scanner will do the job automatically. The price range for this scanner would be around $400-$500. The last Neat scanner is the Neat Desktop scanner; this scanner is perfect for office and professional institutions. Though it does not have the wireless capability of its successor it packs a speeding scanning process by having USB connectivity, it also has all the image format capabilities that makes it versatile when scanning different sized files. This Neat scanner price ranges from $300-$400.
