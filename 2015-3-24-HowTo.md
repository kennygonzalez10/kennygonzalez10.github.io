Many of us that have done previous Graphic Design work that has to be printed out have to be aware of the inconsistency of colors and sizes when a job has gone out to print. We first  must make sure that in our image file we are setting it to CMYK mode when working with Photoshop. Also before printing you must over compensate for the tone or hue for colors in your image. This must be done because colors look brighter on a computer screen than in print. As far as file preference you can print in jpegs or pdf. I prefer pdf file because they have more flexibility when it comes to printing from different operating systems like iOS, Microsoft, and Android.
