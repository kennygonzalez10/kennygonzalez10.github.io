title: This is how MIU is putting your beautiful left brain to work!
---

Have you ever been faced with an assignment that puts you in a creative block? It is quite hard to come up with good ideas in an instant. That is why the MIU institute is hosting this brand new and exciting event that will help students boost their creativity. This event revolves around a series of activities that incorporate the influence of building or inspiration of creativity. Everyone who is going to be involved in the specification of certain areas of art, there will be advisors who will be in charge of guiding students of certain majors achieve these activities. No one is to be discouraged from participating in these activities.  It is going to be very fun and collaborative so come with an open mind.  One particular activity that will be engaging in is called *team free drawing*, the way it works is that groups of 4-5 will have separate sheet of paper for each team member. Each individual team member will draw something on the paper and then past over to another member of the team and they will add to your drawing. This is one example of the activities that will be taking place at these events. Many of the events, excluding this one will require physical effort on the studentâ€™s part so bring some sporty gear to train your body before training your mind. What we want students to take from this event is to become stress free. Sure stressing is something that is inevitable and it happens to the best of students, but do not let it get to you. Take time to analyze your body and your mind and join us this Friday at 2pm in room 2013 and from there we will walk to the Margaret Pace Park on the bay behind the school. Any one is welcome to participate and make sure you bring your mind and some sporty attire. In addition, we will make accommodations for student with disabilities and we will be having complimentary food and drinks.
