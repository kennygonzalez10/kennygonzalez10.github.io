<h2>Due to the lost of University of Pheonix students many schools are rethinking their tuition cost</h2>

Many students when they get out of High School with their hard earn diploma they have to make a life choice. That life choice in tells how are they going to live the rest of their lives. Some take over their parents businees, others get normal jobs and move up, but most make the decision to continue their education and go to college or University. With that in mind they have to think about how they are going to pay for this journey they are taking on. Some are fortunate to have parents who save their hard earn money just so that their kids can have an easy fresh start in their journey for higher education. Others have to balance money and education, which is perhaps the hardest thing to do for a young adult to handle at an age where they should be focusing on furthering their knowledge on the career path of their choosing. Often we start to realize why is the education system is set up the way it is now. But then again it is a test of will, one that has the tools to succeed but does not have the drive will stay stagnant. One that doesn't have the tools but has the drive will put themselves to eventually have the tools they need. At the end of the road is just a matter of time and what you do with that time. Many student complain that they do not have the money or the guidance to go to college, sure that can hinder you from attempting to go but it doesn't stop you completely. Success does not derive from success itself; It is manifested by the trials in which failure occurs many times until success is born. Meaning that before you even think of failing at something, do it before even saying you are going to fail. That is why many student that do not have the money feel like they cannot get a decent education. The world is changing rapidly and technology is enhancing the way we learn. A person in this age in time can get a degree online for less than half the cost compared to attending a traditional collge classroom. One great resource that I absolutely recommend is [https://www.coursera.org/](https://www.coursera.org/) this site has every course imaginable on the career path of your choosing.
